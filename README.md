Car Price Prediction is a machine learning project that estimates the selling price of a car based on factors like brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and engine size. By analyzing historical data, the model learns patterns that influence car prices and helps users, buyers, or dealers make data-driven decisions.
